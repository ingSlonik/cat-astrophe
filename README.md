# Cat-astrophe! üêà‚Äç‚¨õüç¨

![Cat-astrophe!](/assets/cover.png)

A small game of skill, luck, and lots of sugar. Guide your hero to their sweet
reward, but be warned: a very unlucky black cat is on the prowl. Cross its path,
and you'll trigger a "Cat-astrophe" ‚Äì a series of ridiculous, randomly generated
unfortunate events.

## The Js13kGames Challenge

This project was built for the [js13kGames](https://js13kgames.com/2025/)
competition, a coding competition where the entire game must fit within a
**13-kilobyte** zip file.

This was also a personal **weekend challenge** for me. The code was written with
passion and speed, which is a nice way of saying please don't judge its quality
too harshly! üòâ

### Tech Stack & Assets

- **Pure Vanilla JS:** The entire game is written in plain TypeScript. No
  libraries, no frameworks, just me against the world.

- **Self-Made Assets:** I'm not a graphic designer or a musician, but I created
  all the visual and audio assets myself. They might look and sound...
  **unique**, but I'm proud of them and the quirky character they bring to the
  game.

## How to Run

To get the game running on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

1. **Run the development server:**

       npm start

   This will open the game in your browser with live reloading.

2. **Build the final game:**

       npm run build

   This script will compile, minify, and package the entire game into a neat
   little zip file, just under 13kB, ready for submission.

## License & Usage

Feel free to read, clone, fork, and modify the code as you wish. It's here to be
learned from and played with.

If you do end up using any part of this project, **please let me know!** It
would absolutely make my day to see that my little game has been useful or has
inspired someone else.

Thanks for checking it out, and I hope you have fun!
